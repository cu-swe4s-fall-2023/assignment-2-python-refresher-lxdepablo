my_utils contains a function called get_columns, which takes as input a csv file, the index of a column to query, a value to look for in that column, and optionally as a keyword argument the index of a column to return from as the result.

print_fires.py uses get_columns to print all the forest fires that happened in the USA from a CSV file containing various data.

run.sh runs print_fires.py.
